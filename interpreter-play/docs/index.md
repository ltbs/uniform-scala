# Play framework interpreter

The play framework interpreter takes a uniform journey and converts it
into a series of web pages.

It can be used in conjunction with Play 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7, and it can be
retrofitted into an existing play application. As the web application
developer you are free to mix and match conventional journeys with
uniform journeys.
