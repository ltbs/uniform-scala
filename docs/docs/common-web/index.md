# Generic Web Interpreters

Uniform provides interpreters that target several web development 
frameworks, and they all inherit from a generic web interpreter. 

There is no need to import the generic component unless you are
building your own interpreter as it will be imported automatically by
whatever web interpreter you choose to utilise.

Therefore please see the relevant section for install instructions.
