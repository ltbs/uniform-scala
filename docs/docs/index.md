# uniform

**Uniform** is a scala [Embedded Domain-specific Language (eDSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language#Usage_patterns) for defining, in abstract terms, an interaction with a user.

This definition can then be used with one or more interpreters to do useful things such as -

- provide a [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) journey
- construct a Logic Table showing input and output
- compile a Javascript-only interface
